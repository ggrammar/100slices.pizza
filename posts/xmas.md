# Christmas Lyrics

## Carol of the Bells

## God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

```
God rest you merry, gentlemen     | Let nothing you dismay
For Jesus Christ our Savior       | Was born upon this day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r | When we were gone a-stray

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, O tidings of comfort and joy
```

## Good King Wenceslas

## (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays

## Jolly Old St. Nicholas

## O Christmas Tree

## Silent Night
