# Christmas Lyrics

## Carol of the Bells

Hark! how the bells

Sweet silver bells

All seem to say

"Throw cares away"

Christmas is here

Bringing good cheer

To young and old

Meek and the bold

Ding, dong ding dong

That is their song

With joyful ring

All caroling

One seems to hear

Words of good cheer

From ev'rywhere

Filling the air

Oh how they pound

Raising the sound

O'er hill and dale

Telling their tale

Gaily they ring

While people sing

Songs of good cheer

Christmas is here

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

---

Hark! how the bells

Sweet silver bells

All seem to say

"Throw cares away"

Christmas is here

Bringing good cheer

To young and old

Meek and the bold

Ding, dong ding dong

That is their song

With joyful ring

All caroling

One seems to hear

Words of good cheer

From ev'rywhere

Filling the air

Oh how they pound

Raising the sound

O'er hill and dale

Telling their tale

Gaily they ring

While people sing

Songs of good cheer

Christmas is here

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

---

On on they send

On without end

Their joyful tone

to every home

## God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

God rest you merry, gentlemen,    

Let nothing you dismay,

For Jesus Christ our Savior       

Was born upon this day

To save us all from Satan's pow'r 

When we were gone a-stray:

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, 

O tidings of comfort and joy

---

From God our heav'nly Father

A blessed angel came,

And unto certain shepherds

Brought tidings of the same,

How that in Bethlehem was born

The son of God by name:

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, 

O tidings of comfort and joy

---

The shepherds at those tidings

Rejoiced much in mind,

And left their flocks a-feeding,

In tempest storm and wind,

And went to Bethlehem straight-way

This bless-ed babe to find:

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, 

O tidings of comfort and joy

## Good King Wenceslas

Good King Wenceslas looked out

On the Feast of Stephen

When the snow lay round about

Deep and crisp and even

Brightly shone the moon that night

Though the frost was cruel

When a poor man came in sight

Gathering winter fuel

---

"Hither, page, and stand by me,

If thou knowst it, telling

Yonder peasant, who is he?

Where and what his dwelling?"

"Sire, he lives a good league hence,

Underneath the mountain

Right against the forest fence

By Saint Agnes fountain."

---

"Bring me flesh and bring me wine

Bring me pine logs hither

Thou and I shall see him dine

When we bear them thither."

Page and monarch, forth they went

Forth they went together

Through the rude winds wild lament

And the bitter weather

---

"Sire, the night is darker now

And the wind blows stronger

Fails my heart, I know not how

I can go no longer."

"Mark my footsteps, good my page!

Tread thou in them boldly:

Thou shall find the winters rage

Freeze thy blood less coldly."

---

In his masters step he trod

Where the snow lay dinted

Heat was in the very sod

Which the Saint had printed

Therefore, Christian men, be sure

Wealth or rank possessing

Ye, who now will bless the poor

Shall yourselves find blessing.

## (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays

'Cause no matter how far away you roam

When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze

For the holidays, you can't beat home sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee, and he was heading for

Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie

From Pennsylvania folks are travellin'

Down to Dixie's sunny shore

From Atlantic to Pacific

Gee, the traffic is terrific

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays

'Cause no matter how far away you roam

If you want to be happy in a million ways

For the holidays, you can't beat home sweet home

## Jolly Old St. Nicholas

Jolly old St.Nicholas

Lean your ear this way

Don't you tell a single soul

What I'm going to say

Christmas Eve is coming soon

Now, you dear old man

Whisper what you'll bring to me

Tell me if you can

---

When the clock is striking twelve

When I'm fast asleep

Down the chimney broad and black

With your pack you'll creep

All the stockings you will find

Hanging in a row

Mine will be the shortest one

You'll be sure to know

---

Johnny wants a pair of skates

Suzie wants a dolly

Nellie wants a story book

She thinks dolls are folly

As for me, my little brain

Isn't very bright

Choose for me, old Santa Claus

What you think is right

## O Christmas Tree

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

The sight of thee at Christmastide

Spreads hope and gladness far and wide

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

---

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou hast a wondrous message.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou hast a wondrous message.

Thou dost proclaim the Savior's birth,

Goodwill to men and peace on earth.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou hast a wondrous message.

## Silent Night

Silent night, holy night

All is calm, all is bright

Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child

Holy Infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace

Sleep in heavenly peace

---

Silent night, holy night

Shepherds quake at the sight

Glories stream from heaven afar

Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia

Christ the Savior is born

Christ the Savior is born

---

Silent night, holy night

Son of God, love's pure light

Radiant beams from Thy holy face

With the dawn of redeeming grace

Jesus Lord, at Thy birth

Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
