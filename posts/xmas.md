# Christmas Lyrics

## Carol of the Bells

## God Rest You Merry Gentlemen

God rest you merry, gentlemen,    Let nothing you dismay

For Jesus Christ our Savior       Was born upon this day

To save us all from Satan's pow'r When we were gone a-stray

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy, O tidings of comfort and joy

## Good King Wenceslas

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the Feast of Stephen
When the snow lay round about
Deep and crisp and even
Brightly shone the moon that night
Though the frost was cruel
When a poor man came in sight
Gathering winter fuel

"Hither, page, and stand by me,
If thou knowst it, telling
Yonder peasant, who is he?
Where and what his dwelling?"
"Sire, he lives a good league hence,
Underneath the mountain
Right against the forest fence
By Saint Agnes fountain."

"Bring me flesh and bring me wine
Bring me pine logs hither
Thou and I shall see him dine
When we bear them thither."
Page and monarch, forth they went
Forth they went together
Through the rude winds wild lament
And the bitter weather

"Sire, the night is darker now
And the wind blows stronger
Fails my heart, I know not how
I can go no longer."
"Mark my footsteps, good my page!
Tread thou in them boldly:
Thou shall find the winters rage
Freeze thy blood less coldly."

In his masters step he trod
Where the snow lay dinted
Heat was in the very sod
Which the Saint had printed
Therefore, Christian men, be sure
Wealth or rank possessing
Ye, who now will bless the poor
Shall yourselves find blessing.

## (There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays

'Cause no matter how far away you roam

When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze

For the holidays, you can't beat home sweet home

I met a man who lives in Tennessee, and he was heading for

Pennsylvania and some homemade pumpkin pie

From Pennsylvania folks are travellin'

Down to Dixie's sunny shore

From Atlantic to Pacific

Gee, the traffic is terrific

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays

'Cause no matter how far away you roam

If you want to be happy in a million ways

For the holidays, you can't beat home sweet home

## Jolly Old St. Nicholas

## O Christmas Tree

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

---

The sight of thee at Christmastide

Spreads hope and gladness far and wide

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou tree most fair and lovely!

---

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree!

Thou hast a wondrous message.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou hast a wondrous message.

---

Thou dost proclaim the Savior's birth,

Goodwill to men and peace on earth.

O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,

Thou hast a wondrous message.
